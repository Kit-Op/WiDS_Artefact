# WiDS_Artefact
Code for medical heath data regression ML proving high bias regardless model type. Data-set is confidential.

Artefact_Thesis_Studies_ML.ipynb computes different by use of different regression models, techniques and optimisation frameworks looks wheather it is possible to maintain data of all persons represented in the with the societal bias unchanged. 

It uses traditional model frameworks, neural network solutions, and parameter optimisation techniques in order to acheave as high variance as possible while maintaining the bias within the data it self. 

The aim of the study was to prove biases existance in real world data and measure it's impact on ML models. Study managed to prove statistical significance in different values and their overall impact on the target variable. Study managed to prove biases presence by measuring skewness of data. The sparsity of such data and complexity of the issue could not give accurate prediction while maintaining the integrity of the data, thus considering it unethical to use as an administrative tool within healthcare sector.
